## Steps I followed
1. Write the steps you followed here.  This way you can keep track of where you might have messed up if the project does not work. 

## Problems
Note your problems or errors here.  Google any error you may come across, and not what you tried (even if it does not work), and what was the final answer.

Example
1. Arduino code will not load on ESP32 Cam.
   Answer: Camera drivers were incorrect I needed to install the driver: [https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_ZIP.html](https://github.com/martin-ger/esp32_nat_router).  I used file, "CH341SER.ZIP" and it worked.
